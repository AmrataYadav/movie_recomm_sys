# movie_recomm_sys

Machine learning, streamlit, python
Dataset: Downloaded a movie recommendation system dataset from the kaggle of 5000 movies(tmdb credits dataset and tmdb movie dataset).
Machine Learning: Utilized content-based filtering techniques to create an effective recommendation engine.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed movie metadata and user interaction data to ensure data quality for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features from movie attributes (genres, directors, actors) to enhance recommendation accuracy.
Model Building: Implemented content-based algorithms (Bag-of-words, cosine similarity) to generate recommenda- tions.
Algorithm used: From keywords, taken out some useful keywords, from cast and crew, taken out the actors and directors name and kept the genres and put all the words in a list
Web app: Used streamlit to make a user friendly web app for using our model in a easy and simple way.
